## Tasks

### Clarisse
  - Week 01 nov and 08 nov

Read and Inspect Data: I have decided to first consider year 2019, and to study the distribution of happiness in each part of the world ( Europe, South America, Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, East Asia and West Asia), then I have decided to study the distribution of hapiness according to the GDP. Indeed, I have decided to split countries in function of their wealth.I have then perform cluster analysis ( with k means) to group the observations based on the characteristics they possess (life ladder, log GDP per capita,healthy life expectancy at birth,perceptions of corruptions,positive and negative affect.) I have found different clusters, and try to find the best number of clusters.The next step is to plot a map with the countries which belong to different clusters.

  -Week 15 nov
  Continuation and end of cluster analysis. Create parallel coordinate plot. Analysis of standard deviation to measure diffence in dispersion of the index of happiness. End of the writting of the report. 
                         

### Ilan
  - Week 01 nov and 08 nov

Inspect Data and understand the methodology of data collection. Focus on healthy life expectation, search for life expectation data. Writing the methodology section in report

### Marie
  - Week 01 nov

Read about data + Search in internet for some context. Write sketch of report (Introduction + Question +Ideas of plan). Start to answer: Are people living in richer countries happier ? Correlation test + Scatterplot

  - Week 08 nov:

  Continue to answer the question : Are people living in richer countries happier ? Re-do the plot+ correlation tests of week 08nov because change of data set 2020 --> 2021.   Add some more Scatter plot on R. Redaction of the answer and observation in the report.

  -week 15 nov
  
 Creation in R + add on report the two maps on hapiness and GDP and the two plots distribution happpiness and GDP per regions + distr indicators
  
  
### Paul
  - Week 08 nov

Investigating the impact of social features on happiness: corruption, freedom, social support. Search for some interpretations of the correlations


### Raphaël
  - Week 08 nov

Happiness vs time. Checking the data globally. Need to ‘clean’ the data. Kept only few (65) observations to be consistent over the years. Global and per country analysis. Creation of the map for the cluster part.
